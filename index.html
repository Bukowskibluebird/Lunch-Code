    <article> <p>I come home every few months.<br>
    The town changes, little by little, <br>
    like an old relative.<br>
    A new perfume, a different dress,<br>
    another tumor.</p>
    
    <p>Like a thief, time robs me<br>
    while I sleep.<br>
    It's the little things that vanish first.<br>
    They're gone, as if they had never existed,<br>
    as if I'd made it all up.<br>
    Even now, I feel like I'm asleep,<br>
    like I'm not really here.  <br>
    Like I'm not really anywhere.</p>
        
   <p> The places we used to go—<br>
    they long for us in the wind,<br>
    wondering where we've gone<br>
    and if we'll ever return.</p>
    
   <p> I will return to them, <br>
    once or twice in this lifetime,<br>
    never knowing which moment <br>
    will be the last.<br>
    It won't ever be the same.</p>
    
   <p>We've let you die.<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
    
   <p>Like the fading,<br>
    whispering jazz halls,<br>
    you never knew how much<br>
    you loved her until she's gone<br>
    or beyond recognizable.<br>
    Or maybe it's me she can't recognize.</p>
    
   <p>I come home every few months, <br>
    and I climb into the bed of my boyhood.<br>
    I sleep on the edge;<br>
    there’s no more room for any more<br>
    than there ever was.</p>
    
    <p>After all, <br>
    I'm not really here,<br>
    am I?<br>
    There's a shadow pushing<br>
    me out, a little more each night.<br>
    I am not welcome here.</p>
    
    <p>I try to remember<br>
    what it was like to be that child, <br>
    that shadow, that stranger<br>
    in my old skin.<br>
    Strange how alive he is,<br>
    how a corpse smiles.</p>
    
    <p>I want to ask him why left, <br>
    but the words don’t form.<br>
    I won't.<br>
    I can't.</p>
    
    <p>I can't wake that beautiful boy,<br>
    that face my mother loved so.<br>
    I can't risk it.<br>
    What if he breaks again?</p>
    
    <p>That is to say,<br>
    Do you ever feel more like<br>
    a place than a person?  <br>
    Like a vacancy waiting to be filled?<br>
    People come,<br>
    only to go.<br>
    No, they don't complete you;<br>
    they're not supposed to.<br>
    But what good are you alone?</p>
    
    <p>In this flesh, I wait, <br>
    a way station stranded in this <br>
    rat race of the living,<br>
    wings clipped, heart bolted and <br>
    shackled to the wastes of the earth.</p>
    
   <p> I am no different than <br>
    all the places I have abandoned.</p>
    
   <p> Behind a chain-link fence,<br>
    I watch their backs <br>
    fade into the distance.</p>
    
    <p>I was born to watch you leave me.</p>
